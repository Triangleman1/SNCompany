# SNCompany

I smeared my full name across the main menu logo, very terribly.

Fines are removed. Replaced by a gentle chiding.

Grading algorithm better represents player effort and efficiency.
Takes into account:
  - Dungeon Size (approximates exponential and linear components of the increased time required to search larger dungeons)
  - Player Number (at start and end of each round)
  - Quantity of scrap recovered (weighted average with scrap value)
    - This lowers the effect of extremely high value scrap, like sellbodies corpses and the facility meltdown apparatus
    
With more players at small dungeon sizes, it will not be possible to get an S. This is intentional. Four players 100% clearing adamance/offense is the S threshold I balanced for.
