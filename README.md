# SNCompany

I smeared my full name across the main menu logo, very terribly.

Fines are removed. Replaced by a gentle chiding.

New grading algorithm properly represents player effort and efficiency.
Takes into account:
  - Dungeon Size, and the exponential time increase of exploring larger dungeons
  - Players connected
  - Quantity of scrap recovered, rather than just quality
  - Fire exits 
  - Traversal time of each vanilla moon

    
With more players at small dungeon sizes, it will not be possible to get an S. This is intentional. Four players 100% clearing adamance/offense is the S threshold I balanced for.
