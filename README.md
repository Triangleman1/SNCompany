This is going to hold all of my modding projects, for my convenience. Once each is ready they'll be split off under separate labels. I'm building towards a major routing overhaul, piece by piece.

## Subsidies
The company will now lower routing costs based on how well you clear the facility each day. A higher letter grade corresponds to a greater percentage off from routing, up to a maximum discount (that also increases with grade). Works best with dynamic pricing.
  - It is now most cost effective to move between moons throughout your quota, particularly in an outward fashion.
    - More moon variety per session
    - Increasing difficulty throughout quota
  - Greater routing freedom in the late-game. 
    - Will face less weathers. 
    - Can move between nearby moons at low cost.
  - More pressure on all days 
    - Failure on the early days will limit how far out into the solar system you go
    - Failure on later days will occur on the most profitable moons of the quota
    - (One bad day out of three will lower overall yield by much more than 33%)

## Grading
New grading algorithm properly represents player effort and efficiency.
It takes into account:
  - Dungeon Size, and the exponential time increase of exploring larger dungeons
  - Players connected
  - Quantity of scrap recovered, rather than just quality
  - Number of Fire exits
  - Traversal time across each vanilla moon

With more players or at small dungeon sizes, it will not be possible to get an S. This is intentional. Four players 100% clearing adamance/offense/march is the S threshold it automatically balances for.

## Misc
Fines are removed. Replaced by a gentle chiding.

Optional vandalism of main logo.

Configurable.
